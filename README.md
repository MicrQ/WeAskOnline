# WeAsk.Online
This is the official api repository for the development of WeAskOnline. It features a python based application programming interface which serves as the architecture for the server logic of storing user data and processing of request.

WeAskOnline is question and answer community platform where questions are asked and feedback from other users are commented without the involvement of AI.

It is implemented in such a way that the frontend communicates to the backend via HTTP Methods such as GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and others, which would be rendered to the frontend along side the response status codes.
